# Churn-data-analysis

# Project Background :
I'm utilizing a fictitious churn dataset from a Telecom provider called Databel. In my role as a consultant, my primary task is to analyze the reasons behind customers churning, or in simpler terms, why they are leaving Databel.
# Data Description:
The dataset contains numerous dimensions, the first one being Customer_id. The Customer_id is a unique ID that identifies an individual customer. The second column is called Churn Label, and it indicates if a customer churned with "Yes" or "No". The dataset contains various other dimensions, such as demographic fields and information about premium plans
# Data Preparation
* Added two columns one for churn and secondly for age group to add more senses to my analysis
